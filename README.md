# Simulations on Supersingular Isogeny Graph

This repository includes various simulations written in Sage for supersingular isogeny graphs to estimate the distribution of public and secret keys of SIDH/SIKE schemes. The code is partially based on [Erik Thormarker's similar work](https://github.com/eriktho/thesis-sage-code).
